# Knowledge bases for Amazon Bedrock

Knowledge bases for Amazon Bedrock provides you the capability of amassing data sources into a repository of information. With knowledge bases, you can easily build an application that takes advantage of retrieval augmented generation (RAG), a technique in which the retrieval of information from data sources augments the generation of model responses. For more information, visit the AWS documentation [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base.html).
