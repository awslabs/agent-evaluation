# Agent Evaluation

Agent Evaluation is a generative AI-powered framework for testing virtual agents.

Internally, Agent Evaluation implements an LLM agent (evaluator) that will orchestrate conversations with your own agent (target) and evaluate the responses during the conversation.

## Key features

- Built-in support for popular AWS services including [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/), [Amazon Q Business](https://aws.amazon.com/q/business/), and [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/). You can also [bring your own agent](https://awslabs.github.io/agent-evaluation/targets/custom_targets/) to test using Agent Evaluation.
- Orchestrate concurrent, multi-turn conversations with your agent while evaluating its responses.
- Define [hooks](https://awslabs.github.io/agent-evaluation/hooks/) to perform additional tasks such as integration testing.
- Can be incorporated into CI/CD pipelines to expedite the time to delivery while maintaining the stability of agents in production environments.
